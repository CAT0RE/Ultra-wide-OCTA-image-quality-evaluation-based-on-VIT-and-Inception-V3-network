# Ultra-wide-OCTA-image-quality-evaluation-based-on-VIT-and-Inception-V3-network
Ultra-wide optical coherence tomography (OCTA) has become an important imaging method for the diagnosis of diabetes retinopathy (DR). However, there are still few studies focusing on DR automatic analysis using ultra-wide OCTA. In this project, we propose a novel and practical deep learning solution based on ultra-wide OCTA for diabetes retinopathy analysis challenge (DRAC). In the image quality assessment task, the Vision Transformer and Perception-V3 network are used to build models respectively, and the training results are compared horizontally. Finally, the Kappa parameters of 0.7476 and 0.7321 are obtained respectively.
